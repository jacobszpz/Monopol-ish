# MONOPOL*ish*

![GPLv2][license-badge]



> For this assignment, you will work towards implementing a simplified version of the classic board
> game Monopoly. This is not an interactive game you can play, but rather a simulation of two players
> taking turns over a set number of rounds. Play is to be automated according to a sequence of pseudo-
> random numbers - there is no artificial intelligence, and no user input. All output will be text based
> and directed towards the console â€“ there are no graphical elements to this assignment.
